## Adding an organization

**Important notes**:

- In order to avoid duplicates, please search [existing pull requests](https://github.com/rozumdev/techspots-krakow/pulls) before submitting a new one.
- Make sure the organization you'd like to add is clearly related to tech.

Edit `README.md`:

- Choose one of the sections available. If no section fits the organization, feel free to [add a section](#adding-a-section).
- Add the organization to the section (**keep alphabetical order**):
    ```markdown
    ---
    [Organization name](https://example.com)

    [![LiknedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-%230077B5.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/example/)
    [![Meetup](https://img.shields.io/badge/Meetup-f64363?logo=meetup&logoColor=white)](https://www.meetup.com/example/)

    A short description which ends with a period.
    ```
- Check spelling and grammar.
- Remove any trailing white space, and separate all headers, paragraphs, lists and code snippets with an empty line.

Once that's done, you can [submit a PR](https://github.com/rozumdev/techspots-krakow/compare).


## Adding a section

- Add the section to the table of contents (**keep alphabetical order**):

```markdown

```
